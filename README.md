# Beauty and Startup Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of key metrics for a beauty startup, focusing on supply chain efficiency, sales performance, cost management, and quality control. The analysis utilizes SQL for data extraction and R for detailed statistical evaluation and visualization.

## What I Did

#### Data Extraction with SQL:

Analyzed total revenue, top-selling products, average stock levels, lead times, shipping costs, and defect rates.
Calculated manufacturing costs and revenues by product type.

#### Statistical Analysis with R:

Generated visualizations and insights for total revenue, units sold, lead times, manufacturing costs, shipping costs, and defect rates.
Analyzed correlations between key metrics like revenue, number of products sold, manufacturing costs, lead time, and defect rates.
How It Was Done

#### SQL Queries:
Extracted data on revenue, sales, stock levels, lead times, shipping costs, and defect rates.

#### R Analysis:
Created visualizations using R Markdown to illustrate revenue distribution, proportions of units sold, lead times, manufacturing costs, shipping costs, defect rates, and correlations between metrics.
The R Markdown file, named presentation.Rmd, includes all analyses and visual outputs.

## Results

#### Revenue Insights:

Skincare products lead with the highest total revenue of $241,628.17.
